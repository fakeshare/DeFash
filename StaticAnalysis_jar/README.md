# Static Data-flow Analysis 
The data flow analysis code is mainly developed based on FlowDroid. We package it into a jar format for batch operation on the command line. 
The jar package can be obtained through the GoogleDriver link in the project root directory.(https://github.com/fakeshare/DeFash.git)
